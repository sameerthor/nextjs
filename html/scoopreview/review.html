                        <h1>Sally Beauty Review: Introductory Note </h1>
                        <p>Via its affiliates, Sally Beauty is the world's leading distributor of professional beauty supplies. Sally offers the means via which producers of beauty goods may contact both professional and non-professional clients. In 1964, Sally Beauty Company, Inc. opened its first store in New Orleans, Louisiana. The company grew slowly until the 1980s, when it developed significantly through acquisitions and new shop openings. Following the addition of a Denton-based business, Sally relocated its corporate headquarters to Denton, Texas, in 1982. Sally purchased a big full-service (professional only) beauty product wholesaler in the Midwestern United States in 1985. The expansion of the full-service business resulted in establishing the firm presently known as Beauty Systems Group LLC, which focuses primarily on distribution to the beauty industry.</p>

                            Sally Beauty Supply and Beauty Systems Group has thriving online (e-commerce) operations. New shop openings and acquisitions are guiding Sally's expansion. With the purchase of an affiliate in the United Kingdom in 1987, Sally became a worldwide firm. Sally and its affiliates now run over 4500 stores in the United States and worldwide. Their worldwide presence has grown to include the United Kingdom, continental Europe, Puerto Rico, Canada, Chile, Peru, Colombia, and Mexico.<br>
                            Sally became a publicly listed business in 2006, with its shares trading on the New York Stock Exchange. Sally and her subsidiaries have long been market leaders. Professional product marketing, distribution, and teaching expertise form the foundation of a strong position in the worldwide market.<br>
                            This, together with robust local growth and worldwide expansion, prepares the firms for continued success in the coming years. All subsidiaries and affiliates share Sally's customer-driven operational culture and vision.

                        <h3>Is it possible for someone else to pick up my Buy Online Pickup In-Store order?</h3><br>
                        <p>Yes, you may name an alternate person to pick up your item during the checkout process. They must provide a government-issued ID and a copy of the Order Confirmation email. Suppose you did not designate an alternate person to pick up your item. In that case, they could bring a copy of the order confirmation email to the shop when they pick it up.</p><br>
                        <h3>I'm looking for suggestions on what things to buy.</h3><br>
                        <p>Their professional and friendly support staff will assist you! Just ask Sally for hair and nail lessons and advice.</p><br>
                        <h3 id="qty">Why are certain goods limited in quantity?</h3><br>
                        <p>They have imposed quantity limits on purchasing some items due to limited availability or the nature of their constituents.</p>
